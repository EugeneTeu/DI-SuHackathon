Hello, welcome to my GitHub.

This was a project done for NUS HackNRoll 2019. 
Created in collaboration with me (Git: EugeneTeu) , Stanley,  wei Liang and Chi hen.
Was created over a span of 24 hrs. 


This is a motion based sensor game written in java. The motion controller is an Arduino bot connected to the game via  bluetooth and written using the J/SerialPort  library. 
This game can be run entirely with WASD and with no arduino input. Just ignore the errors in the console.

Instructions to run and compile source file: 

After downloading the files, run the following commands in terminal : 
javac -cp .:game/jSerialComm.jar game/Game.java
java -cp .:jSerialComm.jar game/Game

The game should start automatically!

Enjoy!
